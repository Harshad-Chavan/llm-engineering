I had about 4 acres of transplanted rice and 2 acres of maize; everything was washed away. Seedlings, fertilizer and the cost of labour are all lost. I estimate the crop loss at roughly ₹1.5 lakh, and I have no harvest income until the next season.\n",
      "\n",

      "- Immediate cash relief to cover losses and household needs;\n",
      "- Emergency seed and fertilizer distribution so I can replant in time for the next window;\n",
      "- Waiver or moratorium on existing farm loans for at least one crop cycle;\n",
      "- Fast-tracked crop-loss assessment and compensation under the crop insurance scheme (PMFBY or relevant program);\n",
      "- Access to low-interest rehabilitation loans / grants for replacing inputs and labour.\n",

      "- District Agriculture Officer / District Collector (DM): request urgent relief, seed/fertilizer distribution and loan moratorium. These offices coordinate relief and disaster funds.\n",
      "- Your bank branch: request moratorium or restructuring on existing farm loans; give them the damage documents.\n",
      "- Insurance company (PMFBY or private): notify insurer and submit the claim form and supporting documents. Ask them for the crop-loss assessment schedule and the timeline for compensation.\n",
      "- Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) or local agriculture extension worker: for emergency seed/fertilizer assistance and replanting guidance.\n",
